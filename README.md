# ml Re-Learning Journey
## Background
Hi there!
I'm a self-taught ML engineer with over 7 years of experience and in a few months, I'm going to complete 8 years in the industry. I have worked in multiple organisation, several teams in each organisations, on POCs as well as live projects and so on...

Yet, I feel like I know so little. Sometimes I feel that I don't even remember everything that I have learn't and worked on. This is already scary, but add to it the fact that Copilots have made it way too easy to get your work done without getting frustated (aka learning). You get the picture already.

So this repo is my attempt at re-learning everything ML. I want to:
- **learn what I have forgotten**,
- **fill the gaps in my knowledge** wrt what I was too lazy to learn and,
- **skillup on the new advances in ML** that I haven't yet gotten around to learning.

I will add my learning plans, my field notes as well as code etc that I write on my way here. I don't have everything sorted out, but I'm excited AF!
